His wife, Ingeborg, and his daughters, Renate and Gabriele, spend the next seven years not knowing if Thomas was alive or dead.  Then, in 1980, an IRA informant led police to recover his body.  But the trauma for the Niedermayers did not end then: there were further devastating consequences for all of them.  Thomas and Ingeborg’s only granddaughters, Tanya and Rachel, were told nothing of this history when they were growing up.  Now, 50 years after their grandfather was kidnapped, they have embarked on a painful journey of discovery – to find out the shocking truth of what really happened half-a-century ago.",

Using rarely-seen nuclear test footage alongside more poetic images and new film from the nuclear test site in Nevada, I See A Darkness questions cinema's relationship with the material world, with contributions from leading philosophers and writers.",
