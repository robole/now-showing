# Todo

1. Change filter dropdown to use custom disclosure widget.
1. Change popup dialogs to use new `dialog` element?
1. Prevent scrolling when dialog is visible. There is a property for that.
1. Add more fields to filter: release date,..?
1. Add e2e test. What is the demarcation between unit and e2e?
1. Add compact view?
1. Get user country location from edge handler? <https://docs.netlify.com/edge-handlers/api-overview/#geolocation>
1. Maybe, a dedicated view to show the trailers of all of the movies would be cool! Too much work?
1. Show times for the local cinemas. Is there free data available somewhere?
